/* messenger-bot UI — vanilla, no build step.
 *
 * One file on purpose: the whole app is five panels over a REST API, and a
 * bundler would add more moving parts than it removes.
 *
 * The shape is meetup-bot's, deliberately. What changed is the domain under it:
 * a target's follower list where meetup-bot had an event's attendee list, a DM
 * where it had a message, and a "collect" mode — followers, likers, list members
 * — where it had nothing, because an event has exactly one attendee list and an
 * X account has half a dozen pools hanging off it.
 *
 * There is NO backend in this repo yet. `mock.js` stands in for one: it answers
 * the same paths with the same shapes, out of localStorage. Everything below is
 * written against the HTTP contract, not against the mock — see `api()`.
